## Pomodoro Clock: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Pomodoro Clock app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Tony Nguyen. The source code is available on GitHub under the GNU AGPL license (3.0 or later).

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how frustrating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

### Data collected by the app

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences (like clock interval and ringtones)) created by the you (the user) is stored locally in your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. No analytics software is present in the app either.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

Currently No permission is required to use the app

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it.

Yours sincerely,  
Tony Nguyen.
